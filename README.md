# CSC211H Final Project Spring 2024

**Project title**: CSC 211H Honors Project

**inspiration**:

Me, along with many of my friends, peers, and fellow students are victims of mental health problems, so I wanted to create something that can help educate other students on how serious mental health problems can be, and that there are resources available to us.
