# CSC211H Final Project Spring 2024

**Project title**: CSC 211H Honors Project

**inspiration**:

Me, along with many of my friends, peers, and fellow students are victims of mental health problems, so I wanted to create something that can help educate other students on how serious mental health problems can be, and that there are resources available to us.

**What it does**:
I decided to create an informative GUI C++ based application using QT Creator. The application prompts the user to login or create an account. They are then presented with the homepage where they can navigate to "resources for BMCC Students", "Resources for the public", and "minigame". Each page's purpose is to inform the user about various mental health problems.

**Challenges ran into**:

The biggest challenge was getting past the steep learning curve of QT Creator.

**Accomplishments**:

  * Created a login/sign up algorithm using file input/output.
  * Successfully created a functioning GUI Application.
